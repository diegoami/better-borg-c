# Impact milestone 10: two improvement units, the 0099 crash correction and the kit restoration since impact v9

Review package for [milestone 10](https://github.com/diegoami/better-borg-c/milestone/10).

Base: impact v9, tag `4.2.6-impact-v9` on runtime snapshot `33207fbee` (placed 2026-11-09 after
the milestone 9 review and its corrections). Head when this package was written: `25d1ce6a7`
(PR 415), 54 commits and 22 merges after the snapshot. The kit restoration and the
`impact-v10/regression-summary.json` full run land on top of that head in a follow-up PR; they add
fixtures, tooling paths and evidence only, no `src/` change.

This cycle contains **no new bug carry**. Its merged units are two owner-directed **local
improvement units** (I-001, I-002; never proposed upstream, charter in PR 389) and one **crash
correction to an already-carried unit** (0099). Everything else merged in the same window is
governance, tooling, release/docs and death review. Those are listed as exclusions below so a
reviewer can account for every merge without reading any of them as a unit.

The 36 regression-matrix kits that were never tracked are **restored** in this milestone: committed
unchanged under `docs/audit/c-reports/<group>/` with `GROUPS` repointed at them, after the owner's
2026-11-10 deferral (see "Matrix status"). The 0049-era groups still read their baselines from the
gitignored `artifacts/` tree; that residual dependency is disclosed, not hidden.

## The 3 units

| Unit | Consumer | Merged | Evidence / record | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| I-001 one-blow lone-monster attack | #324 | `8a0c1ba09` (PR 394) | `e2f594461` (PR 395), `IMPACT-IMPROVEMENT1.md`, ledger `patches/improvements.json` | targeted life + matrix 225/225 + paired cohort |
| I-002 caution heals while fleeing | #408 | `861ecb2da` (PR 414) | `7485fc192` record, receipt `25d1ce6a7` (PR 415), `IMPACT-IMPROVEMENT2.md`, `patches/improvements.json` | `fleeheal-408` scenario + matrix 234/234 + paired cohort |
| 0099 crash correction | #377 (ledger 0099) | `c1fdc9b12` (PR 398), fix `dbc2bed77` | ledger baseline `17ada0591`, `patches/series.json` 0099 `crash_correction` | `necrolight-crash` fixture, 5 cases, fail-before/pass-after |

All three merge commits are on `main`. Hosted `native` and GitGuardian checks are green on each PR;
no check was weakened or skipped for any of them.

## Unit detail

### I-001: attack a lone adjacent monster one blow would kill (#324, merged `8a0c1ba09`)

Local-only, merged after its contract closed all four acceptance items (PR 394):

* **Hosted gate:** 965/965 + 5/5, tooling 136/136.
* **Targeted life** (seed 1907608237, `--random-birth`): `start.save` sha256 equals the recorded
  D0012 dossier start; notes identical through turn 5987; first divergence at 6017, where the
  improvement fires (the skip removes the retreat-scan RNG consumption); `KILL:the grey mold` at
  8576 and 36413; `turn_cap` alive at 320,000 turns against the recorded death by poison at 27,770.
* **Matrix:** 225/225 cases, zero failed groups, zero row changes, no declarations needed (the
  guard never fires in any fixture).
* **Paired cohort** v1 (Human Warrior, seeds 11/29/47, 20k turns, fixed birth; `37386feca` vs
  `8a0c1ba09`): 6/6 runs alive at cap on both; seeds 29 and 47 identical finals; seed 11 deeper
  (depth 5 / max 6 versus 4 / 5) at identical HP 72 and CL 7.

### I-002: `borg_caution()` heals while fleeing at survivable danger (#408, merged `861ecb2da`)

Local-only, merged after the owner's 2026-11-10 direction ("Fix 408") and its own contract:

* **Hosted gate:** 965/965 + 5/5 on PR 414; the tooling-only release PR 413 is also on the merged
  head, and the post-merge cohort was rerun on the merged head.
* **Scenario fixture** (`tools/fleeing-heal-scenario.c`, matrix group `fleeheal-408`, 4 cases):
  `flee-low` drives the production chooser at the recorded D0017 fatal state (Dwarf Ranger DL21,
  HP 7/230, SP 19/39, poison 485 turns, `goal.fleeing` set, recall read, empty safe grid, 9 CCW +
  Herbal Curing learned). Before build `ac0cc65c5`: rest-for-recall `R500<enter>`, `heal=0 rest=1`,
  the fixture fails its own after-contract. After build: the Herbal Curing cure is queued
  (`sequence=mac`, `heal=1 rest=0`). Fail-before / pass-after at the recorded state values, with
  three controls byte-identical across the builds.
* **Matrix:** 234/234 cases, zero failed groups. `flee-low` is marked `rows_free` as the declared
  intentional transition and pinned by `rows_must`; no other row changed.
* **Paired cohort** v1 (`ac0cc65c5` vs `dfecabb59`, product default config): 6/6 alive at cap on
  both; seeds 29/47 identical finals; seed 11 diverges at turn 4481 (up-stairs flow) with **zero
  heal/cure notes in either life** — the shift is the extra borg-RNG draw of `borg_heal`'s
  `randint0(100)` chance roll, not a spent consumable; final depth 4 / CL 6 / HP 54 versus the old
  life's depth 5 / CL 7 / HP 72, same max depth 6. Unfavourable on that one seed; at n=3 this is
  directional and reported as inconclusive.

**Disclosed contract deviation (I-002):** the recorded D0017 life is not replayable on current
main. 181 commits separate the recorded build `5cd2258dd` from `ac0cc65c5` (the evidence document
counted them as behaviour-active; this package does not re-verify that classification), and the
by-class munchkin default changes the mode for Warriors/Druids/Rangers; the measured driver
hardcodes its `borg.txt`, so a normal-mode rerun of the recorded trajectory was not possible. Both
paired runs finished `turn_cap` alive at 1.2M turns with zero heal/cure actions; the fatal state
itself is covered by the scenario fixture instead.

### 0099 crash correction (PR 398, fix `dbc2bed77`)

The carried `necrolight-296` patch (0099) added the game's lit-square penalty through
`square_islit(cave, borg.c)`. `borg.c` is refreshed by `borg_update_map()`, so on the first think
after a level change it still holds the previous level's position; descending to a smaller level
(dungeon 176x57 -> town 66x22, stale `borg.c` = (117,47)) puts that position outside the new
square array. `square_islit()` bounds-asserts, but the product compiles asserts out, so
`square_light()` read out of bounds — the borg-rs lane's reported SIGSEGV at the first town return
(their issue 21).

Fix: `square_in_bounds(cave, borg.c) &&` before the lit test; an out-of-bounds recorded position is
treated as unlit. Fixture `docs/audit/c-reports/necrolight-296-crash/` (matrix group
`necrolight-crash`, 5 cases): `stale-town` (the recorded geometry), `stale-far` (deterministic
anchor) and the in-bounds controls `lit` / `dark` / `mage-lit` that lock 0099's behaviour (+25 lit,
+0 dark, +0 non-Necromancer caster). Fail-before: the stale modes abort on the `square_in_bounds`
assertion in `square_islit` (cave-square.c:722) pre-fix, which is the recorded segfault in the
NDEBUG product; pass-after: stale modes read as unlit, controls unchanged. This is a correction to
an existing unit, not a new ledger ordinal.

## Matrix status at the v10 head, and the kit restoration

The committed matrix records are the v9 tip run (`docs/measurement/impact-v9/regression-summary.json`,
75 groups / 225 cases, `ok: true`, `at_commit: 33207fbee`) and the per-PR runs above:

* v9 tip: 225 cases.
* after the 0099 crash correction (PR 398): +5 (`necrolight-crash`) = 230.
* after I-002 (PR 414): +4 (`fleeheal-408`) = 234, the run recorded in `IMPACT-IMPROVEMENT2.md`.

**The 36 restored groups now run from a clean checkout**, and the 17 `KIT_GROUPS` fetch their
fixtures from the ledger's evidence commits, so they need those commits in the clone (a full clone,
not a shallow one) but no `artifacts/` tree. 36 of the 60 local `GROUPS` entries used to point at
fixtures under `.worktrees/<carry>/artifacts/...`, which is gitignored; those kits were untracked,
are not on the `task/carry-*` branches, and were removed after the 2026-11-09 v9 review with no
recorded cleanup. Their expected rows and log hashes survived only in the v9 summary. Owner
decision 2026-11-10 (checkpoint 1): restore them in this milestone by committing each kit under
`docs/audit/c-reports/<group>/`, verifying it reproduces the v9 rows, and pointing
`tools/regression-matrix.py` at the committed paths.

That restoration is delivered. Each kit's `scenario.c`, companion headers, `profile/borg.txt` and
recorded baseline logs were copied unchanged (linked binaries, object files, `result.json` and
tarballs are not committed; the kits build from source), and `docs/audit/c-reports/README.md`
records the contents, provenance and residual dependency. I-002's own fixture baselines were
committed the same way in the milestone 10 review corrections (`docs/audit/c-reports/fleeheal-408`),
so all three units now carry repo-resident fixture evidence: 0099 and I-002 by committed kits, and
I-001 by a declared absence (its guard never fires in any fixture). Verification against the
product build on `c1a80e92c`:

* restored groups alone: 36 groups, 91 cases (`text` is declared skipped), **all OK**, zero
  unexpected `OUTCOME` row differences against the v9 baselines;
* `fleeheal-408` on its committed kit: 4/4 OK;
* full matrix: 77 groups, **234 cases, `ok: true`, no failed group**, 183/234 cases byte-identical
  to their recorded baseline logs. The machine-readable run is committed as
  `docs/measurement/impact-v10/regression-summary.json` (`at_commit: 6944d88e8`, the review
  corrections; the earlier run at `c1a80e92c` had the kit files as working-tree files, and the
  run was rerun at the corrections head so that the pin names the commit holding the exact kit
  bytes the run read - the summary file itself lands in the recording commit after it).

The rows that differ from the v9 baseline rows are exactly the declared transitions in `GROUPS`
(`vampire` `near-far`/`near-near` under `rows_must`, `dispel259` `reserve`/`clear` declared
failing, `knockout` `paralysis`); byte differences are information, not failures, because later
carries legitimately touch shared paths.

**Residual dependency (disclosed):** 22 local groups still read their baselines from the gitignored
`artifacts/` tree: the 0049-era groups (swap, knockout, preparation, cold-protection, rings,
potion-timing, itangast, shot-path, brand, stairtrack, acidarc, outoflight, mapwall,
enlightenment, stairreturn, blowname, excavate, calllight, gloves, detectcarry, maimfoe,
recalldepth) and nothing else. They need that tree present. A fresh clone can run the 37 committed
kits and the 17 `KIT_GROUPS` (fetched at their evidence pins), but not those 22 until their
baselines are committed the same way. That is the remaining matrix item.

## Frozen v1 cohort: both units cohort-neutral on survival

Both units were measured on the frozen cohort v1 (Human Warrior, seeds 11/29/47, 20k turns, fixed
birth) against the build each branch started from. Both are 6/6 alive at cap before and after, so
no survival regression was observed; the two progress differences are RNG-shifted trajectories
(I-001 seed 11 deeper; I-002 seed 11 shallower with no consumable spent). Three fixed seeds are not
statistics and no population claim is made in either direction. The frozen cohort file itself is
unchanged this cycle.

## Exclusions and pending items (checked, not counted)

* **I-003 starting purchases (#410): rejected by its own declared margins** and recorded as a
  negative result, not a unit. Policy v1 deadlocked buy/sell in town (median max-depth 5 -> 3);
  v2 fixed the loop but failed cohort 2's margins (4/20 alive->dead losses and 7/20 max-depth
  losses above the declared bounds; three new CL1 deaths with the starting dagger, the predicted
  early-AC cost). Branch `task/imp-003-startbuy` is pushed; its docs-only negative-result record
  (`docs/measurement/STARTBUY-410-REJECTED.md`) is merged to main in the review corrections;
  nothing else from it is merged.
* **Death reviews D0017, D0018, D0019** (PR 404, 402, 407): dossier, evaluation and redesign
  lessons only; no runtime change.
* **Governance/tooling/docs:** 381 (m9 corrections), 382 (m9 state), 383 (v9 tag record), 384
  (borg-rs proposal path), 385 (non-carried review rule), 388 (#324 diagnostic evidence and design
  lesson 1), 389 (improvement charter), 391 (issue claim convention), 393 (remove the accidentally
  committed `.worktrees` symlink), 395 (I-001 measurement record), 396 (replay divergence stop and
  watchdog limits), 397 (README), 405 (replay/branch directory naming), 413 (release packaging),
  and the follow-up kit-restoration PR (36 kits committed under `docs/audit/c-reports/`, `GROUPS`
  repointed, `docs/measurement/impact-v10/` full-run summary). None changes borg or game
  behaviour.
* **Release tag outside the window:** `4.2.6-impact-v9.1` is an annotated tag on branch
  `release/4.2.6-impact-v9.1` (placed 2026-11-10 at owner direction), outside the reviewed range;
  PR 413 cherry-picks its packaging into this window. Only the v10 tag is unplaced, and the
  milestone 9 tag accounting is unaffected.
* **Not attempted / not claimed:** any new bug carry (none was ready in this window); a Rust or
  borg-rs change; an official Angband interaction; a survival or progress claim for either
  improvement.

## Disclosures

* I-001's targeted life diverges from the recorded life at turn 6017 by design; the recorded loop
  after that point does not occur in it.
* I-002's paired targeted rerun could not reproduce the recorded normal-mode life on current main
  (contract deviation above). Its live benefit rests on the fixture and on the cohort result, which
  is directional at n=3.
* The matrix evidence quoted per unit is the run recorded at that unit's own merge time. The
  committed full-run summaries are the v9 tip (`docs/measurement/impact-v9/`) and this cycle's
  head (`docs/measurement/impact-v10/`, which includes both post-v9 groups and the restored
  kits). Each group added after v9 was run in full on its PR and recorded there.
* 0099 is counted once in the ledger; the crash correction is attached to that entry
  (`patches/series.json`). No entry or patch file is added: `patches/series.json` still holds its
  98 patch entries and `patches/` its 98 patch files, while the prose ordinals in
  `patches/README.md` reach "ninetieth ... ninety-ninth" for the same units. This correction
  changes neither count.

## Review

Per the owner's standing instruction, independent/external review is deferred to milestones and the
owner launches any reviewer they choose; this package is the review input.

An internal agent review of this package was performed on PR 416 at the owner's request. It
verified the tag/base identity, the three merge commits and their ledger entries, the matrix totals
chain (225 -> 230 -> 234), the fixture case lists, the absent-kit count, and that no other `src/`
commit exists in the window. It raised three precision findings, all applied before merge:

* **M10-01:** the ledger sentence claimed an ordinal count of 99. The machine-checkable counts are
  98 entries in `patches/series.json` and 98 patch files; the prose ordinals in
  `patches/README.md` reach "ninety-ninth" over the same units. Reworded to state the checkable
  counts and that the correction changes neither.
* **M10-02:** the I-002 disclosure repeated the evidence document's "181 behaviour-active
  commits". 181 is the commit distance between the recorded build and `ac0cc65c5`; the
  behaviour-active classification is not re-verified here. Reworded.
* **M10-03:** "36 of the `GROUPS` fixtures" made the denominator implicit; it is 36 of 60
  entries. Stated precisely.

The verdict is recorded on PR 416. This is not the independent/external review: the owner still
launches that reviewer, and it must not be represented as done.

**Resolved:** the 36-kit restoration was delivered in the follow-up restoration PR, so the owner
can open the milestone for the external reviewer with the remaining `artifacts/` dependency
disclosed rather than with an un-restored kit gap.

**External review, 2026-11-10:** the owner launched an independent reviewer on
[issue 420](https://github.com/diegoami/better-borg-c/issues/420) with the prompt in this
milestone's review map. The verdict was **approve with corrections**; the reviewer read the 53
`src/` lines, reproduced the 0099 fail-before/pass-after on the v9 build, reran the 36 restored
groups (91/91) and `necrolight-crash` (5/5), reproduced the summary and ledger comparisons at
AST/JSON level, and reported seven documentation/evidence findings, no blocking or major ones.
All seven are applied in commit `6944d88e8` (see the next section); nothing was recorded as not
applied. The reviewer also confirmed the internal reviews' three applied findings against the
tree. A same-issue re-review at `46057bc4a` then verified all seven in the tree and returned
**approve**: the `src/` diff after the reviewed head is the comment only, the tool change is the
single kit repoint, and the 37 committed kits run 95/95 in a fresh clone. Its one wording nuance
(which commit holds the summary file) is corrected in the follow-up. The v10 tag remains unplaced
pending explicit owner authorization.

## Review corrections (M10-R-01..07)

All seven findings are applied in `6944d88e8`; none was recorded as not applied. No finding
touched runtime behaviour, and the only `src/` change is a comment.

| Finding | Severity | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M10-R-01: the prevalence check counted 25 dossiers that are not all in the repository | minor | Applied: `IMPACT-IMPROVEMENT2.md` scopes the count to the working record, states that only D0006-D0019 are committed, and records the recount (18/25 at the 5% boundary; the survey's 20/25 differs only there). No conclusion depended on the fraction. |
| M10-R-02: I-002's fixture baselines were uncommitted, so the unit could not be rerun from the repo | minor | Applied: the baselines are committed under `docs/audit/c-reports/fleeheal-408/` and `GROUPS` points there; the group reruns 4/4 and the residual `artifacts/` dependency is now the 22 0049-era groups only. |
| M10-R-03: the map's C6 claimed window-wide unchanged transitions | nit | Applied: scoped to the restoration commit `0263951f8`, with the later m9 declarations and the fleeheal repoint named separately. |
| M10-R-04: the committed run's `at_commit` did not express its relation to the kit commit | nit | Applied: the full run was rerun at the corrections head and re-committed with `at_commit: 6944d88e8`; the README states the working-tree-to-commit relation and uses one build reference. |
| M10-R-05: the v9.1 release tag was not in the tag accounting | nit | Applied: `4.2.6-impact-v9.1` and branch `release/4.2.6-impact-v9.1` are named in the exclusions, with PR 413's cherry-pick. |
| M10-R-06: `borg_thrust_damage_one` was documented as per-blow damage | nit | Applied: the comment now says per-round damage (per-blow times the blow count). Comment only; the guard's behaviour is unchanged. |
| M10-R-07: the I-003 negative-result record lived only on the pushed branch | nit | Applied: `docs/measurement/STARTBUY-410-REJECTED.md` is cherry-picked to main; no policy code is merged. |

After the corrections: full matrix 77 groups / **234 cases, `ok: true`**, zero unexpected row
differences against the v9 baselines, 183/234 byte-identical; `allunittests` 965/965; the 37
committed kits all run from a clean clone.

## Exact next work

1. ~~Restore the 36 `.worktrees` kits~~ done in the restoration PR: committed unchanged under
   `docs/audit/c-reports/<group>/`, `GROUPS` repointed, and the restored groups verified against
   the v9 baseline rows.
2. ~~Create the milestone 10 review issue and let the owner launch the reviewer~~ done: issue 420,
   verdict approve with corrections, corrections applied.
3. Commit the remaining 22 0049-era `artifacts/` baselines the same way, so the full matrix runs
   from a clean checkout without any gitignored dependency.
4. ~~Do not place a v10 tag until the owner authorizes it~~ placed 2026-11-10 on explicit owner
   authorization. As with v8 and v9 the tag is on the runtime snapshot, not on a package commit:
   annotated `4.2.6-impact-v10` -> `6944d88e8`, the review-corrections commit whose `src/` and kit
   bytes the committed v10 matrix run read; the package, the review record and the corrected
   summary follow it on main.

## Tag placement

`4.2.6-impact-v10` is an annotated tag on runtime snapshot `6944d88e8`, placed 2026-11-10 under
explicit owner authorization after the review's disposition (approve with corrections, then
approve on re-review). The annotation records the units, the review, the matrix result, the
cohort result and the residual `artifacts/` dependency; the tag object is
`fa0f663987dc59662e554a14f5fa9a30872699ee`. The later docs-only corrections (`afab41036`,
`46057bc4a`, `4adb4cd7a`) are on main but not inside the tag, exactly as the milestone 9 package
followed its snapshot.
