# Next owner replay and bounded death collection

See the [complete toolkit guide](REPLAY-TOOLKIT.md) for the connected user workflow
and [borg-rs reproduction handoff](BORG-RS-TOOLKIT-PROMPT.md).

Owner clarification: `replay_next_death` opens a death the owner has not reviewed.
It does not automatically diagnose, brainstorm or close technical investigations.

From the repository root:

```sh
./replay_next_death.py --list
./replay_next_death.py
./replay_next_death.py --from-turn 20300
./replay_next_death.py --mark-reviewed D0006
```

Plain replay verifies the original rerun before opening the existing viewer.
Arrow keys step; Space plays; g jumps to a turn; i/e show inventory/equipment, m monsters; Escape
returns from panels and q quits. Focus the terminal/game region to receive keys.
Closing the viewer leaves review status unchanged. Mark reviewed explicitly when
finished; `--mark-unreviewed D0006` reverses that local receipt. `--case D0004`
opens a particular case even if reviewed; `--view-only` explicitly skips rerun
verification and `--verify-only` checks without opening the viewer. `--list --json`
exports the local queue. These commands make no GitHub posts.

Queue selection uses oldest dossier order, groups only the registry's verified
encounter-family mappings, and skips reviewed families and unavailable recordings.
Dossier manifest hashes are checked; replay-borg.py validates the full recording
before use. Missing/corrupt bundles and legacy seed-only dossiers stay visible in
`--list`, not silently marked reviewed. An empty available queue exits0 and says
so; it does not manufacture a game or infer a movie from a seed.

The committed `docs/deaths/owner-reviews.json` seeds the confirmed owner review of
the gallant/D0004 family. Explicit commands write atomic local overrides under
the PRIMARY checkout's `artifacts/death-workflow/owner-reviews.json`, protected by
a lock. All task worktrees share those local receipts. Owner review is independent
of assessment/action status:158/159 remain open despite owner viewing the death.
Historical comments on D0001 do not establish that its full replay was reviewed;
it has no complete recorded movie. D0002/D0003 legacy evidence and D0004/D0005
recordings are one qualified family, not four new choices.

## Collect a new replayable death

```sh
./produce_death.py
./produce_death.py --games 10 --timeout 250
./produce_death.py --games 3 --seed 1001 --turns 200000
./produce_death.py --seeds 1001 1002 1003 --turns 300000 --timeout 120
```

Default: at most3 new random-race/class, default point-buy games, each at most200000
absolute engine turns and120 native wall seconds,30 seconds without progress.
The initial uint32 seed is randomly selected once and the prospective consecutive
seed list is printed/frozen before results. Explicit seeds make the request
copyable. No arbitrary class/Borg-parameter options are supported here; effective
native configuration is recorded. Never silently simulate another configuration.
Cheat death and winner respawn are off; ordinary rules/AI unchanged.

The collector runs **every requested fresh character**, continuing after natural
deaths, wall timeouts and turn caps. `--games 10 --timeout 250` attempts ten
fresh seeded characters, each with up to250wall seconds; it can register several
deaths in one batch. Race/class are randomly chosen for each start and may
repeat. Every natural death is exported under its own Dnnnn dossier and added
to the replay queue. Each run prints its report/watch/play commands; the final
summary lists all registered deaths and the collection's reports.md comparison.

A crash, stall, native/recording error or failed death export still stops the
batch and retains prior deaths and raw evidence. A real death with a recording
error is exported before stopping. Timeouts remain wall_timeout, never deaths;
cap survivors remain cap survivors. No forced death or automatic budget growth:
ten attempts can yield fewer than ten deaths. Default budget stays3 games,
normal mode; `--games` selects a larger bounded batch. This collection is not a
prospectively designed survival/progress experiment.

At startup the command prints the requested source commit/subject and the actual
build it will run. A complete matching cache is reused automatically, including
across documentation/launcher-only commits when game/Borg sources, build inputs,
carry ledger, observer tools, binary and data still match. Provenance retains
the actual build commit; collection.json records requested and actual commits
separately. It does not pull Git changes or switch the checkout.

When a new build/update is required, the interactive offer is:
`Build/update this version before starting games? [Y/n]`. This happens before
acquiring the shared native lock or creating a collection. Declining cancels
without games. Noninteractive callers must pass `--yes` to accept a required
build; `--no-build` requires an existing matching cache. `--check-build` prints
version/cache status and exits without building, locking or running games
(exit0 matching, exit1 missing). A corrupt/incomplete exact cache is preserved
and rejected rather than overwritten. Selection is rechecked under the lock
before the build/run; no prompt holds the lock.

`--ref COMMIT` pins committed runtime source (defaultHEAD). Dirty runtime edits
are not exported. A matching full-recording observer build is cached under the
primary `artifacts/death-workflow/builds`; incomplete/changed cache entries fail
honestly. `--build PATH --ref COMMIT` reuses a supplied compatible recording build
with identical source/tool identities. First build/configure and waiting for the
shared validation lock are separate from native per-game wall limits; progress
and build logs remain visible. Failed builds are retained, not auto-retried.

All games use isolated run directories below PRIMARY `artifacts/death-workflow`;
no personal named save, backups, user settings or desktop sessions are loaded or
published. `--output PATH` must be a new directory under primary artifacts.
`collection.json` freezes the source/seeds/limits/stop rule and retains every
attempt/outcome/error, result hashes, full recording and relevant terminal stats.

A natural death invokes tools/record-death.py under the shared registry lock and
regenerates tools/aggregate-deaths.py. New `docs/deaths/Dnnnn-collected` evidence
starts UNASSESSED, uses its actual build, and enters the owner's replay queue.
`--death-issue URL` overrides the default collection discussion163; a focused
investigation should be linked during curation. Export/recording errors are
failures with preserved raw evidence, not successful completed death protocol.
Dossiers are working-tree changes requiring normal curation/commit/PR review.

After owner replay, the agent still checks feedback, qualifies replay, completes
REVIEW-TEMPLATE.md brainstorming/overall assessment and files evidence-backed
candidate investigations. A queue script never claims that analysis is complete.
Bugs remain first; collection is a direct bounded request, not an automatic queue
that pre-empts active defect work. Survival/progress experiments use the separate
DEATH-IMPROVEMENT-WORKFLOW.md process, not this exploration collector.

## Verification for this delivery

Ten focused controls cover verified-family grouping, legacy/missing/changed
recordings, viewer exit leaving owner status unchanged, reversible local review
overrides, seed-mode validation, refusal of a nonrecording build, multi-death
continuation/export, bounded all-cap completion, stall failure and failed-export evidence.
Existing tooling controls remain required alongside the hosted native gate.

Native smoke: actual source682143f79eeb, seed1001, one game/cap200/timeout30,
result turn_cap at200/20HP, no death or extra seed attempted. Full standalone
recording and collection manifest retained under primary
`artifacts/death-workflow/smoke-cap-1001`. This is a bounded-run check, not mortality
or death-export integration evidence; that export path uses existing tested
record-death.py plus the focused collector controls.

Queue handoff: D0004 historical original C34 recording rerun VERIFIED via
`--case D0004 --verify-only`; receipt in primary
`artifacts/death-workflow/replays/20261107T171050.115944Z/verification.json`.
Owner review ledger and historical dossiers were unchanged; no desktop window,
new natural death or personal character publication. Default queue honestly
reported no unseen available movie.

## Random characters for new exploration games

Owner request: fresh `produce_death.py` games now default to native random race
AND class. `--birth fixed` selects the old Human Warrior profile explicitly.
The native birth menus receive `*`, so the recorded game seed determines both
choices through ordinary game RNG; point buy remains the game's class-specific
default. The prospective seed list, effective input and actual native CHARACTER
are retained. A game is not described as Human Warrior merely because it used
the exploration runner.

Fresh `run-borg-headless.py NAME --turns N` characters use the same random-birth
policy and a randomly chosen seed when --seed is omitted. Explicit --seed is
reproducible, and --birth fixed remains available. Loaded saves retain their
character; visible manual birth still follows the player's choices. Frozen
ordinary measurement cohorts retain their original fixed birth unless explicitly
run with the new --random-birth option. Historical cases and baselines are not
rewritten by this new exploration default.

For a manual attempt at an alternative decision, use
`./play-from-replay.py DOSSIER --from-turn N`. It verifies the historical prefix
and loads a separate native save with the Borg off. First use offers a separate
historical helper build; existing replay engines remain frozen. See
[manual takeover and resume](RECORD-REPLAY.md#play-a-manual-alternative-from-a-recorded-turn).

## Watch or take over a collected survivor

Each completed attempt now prints `Watch:` and `Play yourself:` commands and
stores them in its `collection.json` entry. The commands apply to deaths and
living survivors alike. A timed-out movie uses `--view-only` for watching;
manual play verifies its selected prefix first. Crashed/error recordings may
have a watch-only command but are not offered for takeover.

Retrieve commands for an existing collection without builds or new games:

```sh
./produce_death.py --commands artifacts/death-workflow/collections/TIMESTAMP
```

`--timeout SECONDS` already sets the native **wall-time limit per character**
(default120seconds), separate from build/lock waiting. `--stall-timeout SECONDS`
(default30) limits an unchanged engine turn; `--turns` sets the engine-turn cap.
For example, search up to20fresh characters, allowing each60seconds:

```sh
./produce_death.py --games 20 --timeout 60
```

Wall/turn limits continue to the next declared seed. Three living timeouts are
not three completed200000-turn games or evidence that progress is good; the
engine clock can advance during unproductive town/stair cycles. All outcomes
and recordings remain preserved, and no limits or seeds grow automatically.

## Short game reports

Every new collector attempt prints `Report:` and stores the path in its
collection entry. The report shows character level/highest level, maximum dungeon
depth, recorded kills, experience, gold, turns, Borg decisions, time, version,
seed and actual outcome. Living summaries contain no map or tactical situation.
They link the standard native Angband character dump when it can be formatted
from a preserved living save. Each collection also has a `reports.md` comparison.

Create reports for older collections without replaying them from birth:

```sh
./produce_death.py --reports artifacts/death-workflow/collections/TIMESTAMP
```

The native character sheet is produced by the run's frozen executable loading a
copy of its snapshot, opening the character-sheet/file UI and exiting. No Borg
activation, movement or rest command is supplied. Its displayed game turn and
observed turn/energy/decision counters must match the snapshot. The diagnostic
uses isolated user/save/score directories; original saves, engine, recording
manifest and outcome are not rewritten. Existing valid character sheets are
reused. No fonts, GUI window or new build are needed.

Kills come from the native save's version-1 `monster memory` block (`pkills`,
this character's recorded kills), not the all-lives lore count or repeated Borg
message lines. Invisible non-unique kills may be absent, as in the native lore.
The reader validates the Angband save magic, block sizes/checksums and supported
block versions. A stale snapshot is explicitly dated; missing or unsupported
counters are reported unavailable, never zero. A dead save is not resurrected
for formatting; its short report still records the death outcome/cause and any
available saved counters. Native-formatting failures retain diagnostics and do
not invent a character sheet.

`--commands COLLECTION` remains read-only and now includes existing report paths.
`--reports` may run a short native save-load/formatting diagnostic under the
shared validation lock; it does not continue the game or change the cohort.
Generated summaries/native dumps stay outside Git beside the raw runs.

## Start in the native munchkin mode

```sh
./produce_death.py --games 3 --timeout 120 --munchkin
```

`--munchkin` appends `borg_munchkin_start = TRUE` to the isolated run's Borg
configuration and freezes that requested parameter/configuration hash in the
collection plan before outcomes. Race/class remain random unless `--birth fixed`
is supplied. Without the flag the old default configuration bytes are unchanged.
Native level/depth limits and other settings remain their existing defaults;
this flag selects existing behavior and adds no new gameplay policy. Cheat death
and winner respawn stay off. Reports and natural-death export work as usual.

Native smoke: fixed Human Warrior, seed11,200turn cap/30s wall, one game;
effective native `BORG_OPTIONS` records munchkin_start1,cheat_death0,respawn0;
turn-cap alive with both short report and native character dump produced.
This short setup test verifies the option reaches the native Borg, not the
long-term quality/liveness of the mode. Known source403/consumer204 stair-cycle
investigation remains separate: the normal stall/time bounds stay active, and
an operational stall stops collection rather than becoming a death or survivor.

Owner preference2026-11-08: subsequent death collection uses **normal Borg**.
Do not start new munchkin game runs unless the owner explicitly requests it
again. Historical movies keep their actual parameters; the CLI flag remains
available for explicit reproduction, not an instruction to run that mode.

## Multi-death batch verification (2026-11-08)

Deterministic collector controls exercise ten distinct fresh run directories and
seeds with ten separately exported deaths, mixed death/turn-cap batches, timeout
continuation, death export failure, native errors on death, and a crash after an
earlier successful death. These are simulated control outcomes, not ten newly
played native games or a population measurement. Existing native death export,
reports and queue validation remain required. No native collection was started
just to test the new loop.

## Reading collector output

Build selection, collection plan, each game and the final batch summary have
separate headings. Game results show the outcome, character, elapsed seconds
and final recorded turn/level/depth. Watch, manual-play and queue commands
appear on separate indented lines with blank space for easy copying; report
paths are labeled separately.

Interactive terminals use colored headings/status and bright cyan commands.
Redirected/piped output stays plain text, and `NO_COLOR=1` or `TERM=dumb`
disables color. Existing recording identities and stored commands remain plain
text. The layout takes effect on the next invocation; an already running batch
continues with its loaded script.
